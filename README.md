Sample code from a C++ class


Produce a program that corresponds to the following:

You will implement a C++ program called Hunter Cafe EMS. This program will display a menu with food and drink options and their prices, and will prompt the user select the items they wish to purchase. When the user selects an item, the program will ask how many of that item the user wants. The program will then ask the user whether (s)he wants to order additional items of if (s)he is done. If the user selects to order additional items, the menu is printed again and the above is repeated. When the user is done, the program will print out the list of items ordered and their prices as well as the total price. It will then prompt the user whether they are satisfied with their purchase. If the user is satisfied, the program prints "Thank you for using Hunter Cafe EMS!". Otherwise the program gives the option to start over or add items to the order.
